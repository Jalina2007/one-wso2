// Registry of CadO2, the quote tool, surfaced as a group inside the Sales
// perspective. Its own file and its own id set for the same reason as
// misApps.ts: these rows are decided by CadO2's own `/me` (useCado2RailGate),
// not by the meet-app gate that owns SALES_ITEM_IDS, and not by people-app
// capabilities.
//
// `requires: ["admin"]` on every item means RESTRICTED, nothing more: the
// visibility fold hands these ids to the `cado2` adapter, which decides
// against CadO2's roles. An id missing from CADO2_ITEM_IDS would fall through
// to the capability check and show to people-app admins instead.
