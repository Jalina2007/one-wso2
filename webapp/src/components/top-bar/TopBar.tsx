// Firefox and Safari and absent from TypeScript's DOM lib. A layered check
// would therefore fall through to this same call on two of three engines while

// Brand lockup sizing. Constrained by https://wso2.com/about/brand, which is
// stricter than it looks — check there before changing any of this:
//
//  - "Icon should not be isolated." The pulse mark may not be used apart from
//    the wordmark, so the full logo asset is the only option here — regardless
//    of what any other app does. (The favicon is the one exception, because a
//    ~16px square slot cannot hold a 2.5:1 lockup at all.)
//  - The logo "is strictly monochrome": black on light, white on dark. Orange
//    (#F14E23) is approved for the icon on DARK backgrounds only, so it can't be
//    used on this header, whose background is `background.paper`.
//  - The padding inside the SVG is not slack to be cropped out — it is the
//    mandated clear space ("4x padding"). Leave it alone.
//
// Sizing: the visible letters are half the height set here (artwork occupies
// y 163.7-490.6 of a 0-654.2 viewBox). "One" is one word of the two-word name,
// so it has to render at the same letter height as "WSO2" beside it — these two
// constants move together. Inter at weight 600 has a 0.7375x cap height,
// measured in a browser:
//
//   title px   cap height   logo px to match
//   18         13.27        26.5   <- Oxygen's own BrandTitle token
//   22         16.22        32.4   <- chosen; the pair scaled up for presence
//   24         17.70        35.4
//
// UNRESOLVED: the brand minimum for digital use is 180x72px, which at this
// aspect means a 72px-tall logo. The Oxygen toolbar is 56px (xs) / 64px (sm+),
// so no compliant-minimum logo fits. Needs a ruling from the brand owner on
// what applies to product chrome; every value here is below that minimum.
