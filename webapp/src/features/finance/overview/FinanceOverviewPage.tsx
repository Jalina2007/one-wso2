 * Finance → Overview. Used to be a rail group that expanded into two rows —
 * Credit Card Expenses, OPD Claims — each its own click before you reached
 * either dashboard. This is the one screen the rail now sends you to; the
 * dropdown does the switching that used to be a second click in the sidebar.
 *
 * No header of its own — the dropdown TAKES THE PLACE of whichever
 * dashboard's own eyebrow chip would show, via `FinanceShell`'s `actions`
 * slot (see `headerActions` below; `FinanceShell` renders `actions ?? <Chip
 * .../>`, never both) — the dropdown already says which section is showing,
 * so the chip would only repeat it.
 *
 * Neither dashboard changed to get here — each is still the exact same
 * default-exported page (own eyebrow chip, title, config-gating, loading and
 * error states), just chosen by the dropdown instead of a route.
 * `OpdDashboardScreen` in particular still enforces its own finance-approver
 * role check internally, so someone without it sees that screen's own
 * notice, not a missing option.

  // plain `useState("cc")` would freeze on "cc" even after the OPD-only
  // reader's access resolved, since nothing ever re-triggers a `useState`
  // initializer. An OPD-only approver (no card, no CC role) opens straight
  // on the dashboard they can actually use; everyone else keeps the current
  // "cc" default.

  // erroring OPD lookup has nothing else that would put them here) — landing

  // below would come back empty for that reader (neither branch of its
