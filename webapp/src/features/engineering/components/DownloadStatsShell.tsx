// Shared page frame for every Download Stats screen: the perspective header
// with the screen's title and its one-line description, and —
// the reason this exists — ONE place that owns every degraded state, so no
// screen has to remember them and none of them differs (MisShell is the
// precedent). The ladder, in order:
//
//   1. preview flag off            → Engineering isn't available yet
//   2. API address not set         → say which config key is missing; ask nothing
//   3. address is http, not local  → refuse to put the token on the wire
//   4. Admin check still in flight → spinner, never a premature denial
//   5. Admin check failed          → an error with Retry, NOT a denial
//   6. the API says not an Admin   → say what Admin is for and who to ask
//   7. the screen
//
// Rungs 4–6 are Admin's alone: the other five screens are open to every
// signed-in employee, so nobody is asked about and nothing is awaited. Rungs
// 5 and 6 stay distinct deliberately — both leave the client holding no
// answer, and collapsing them tells someone whose gateway timed out that they
// lack a role they already have.
//
// ---- how a screen uses it -------------------------------------------------
//
// A page is a thin wrapper, `<DownloadStatsShell screen="downloads">` around
// a body component, and the body holds every query hook. That is load-bearing
// rather than tidy: `children` is mounted only on the last rung, so a body
// inside the shell cannot send a request while the API address is unset or
// the reader is being refused. The title and description come from the
// registry entry for `screen`, the same entry the rail reads its label from.
//
// `actions` (a button beside the title, as Admin's "Add tracked repository")
// belongs to the screen, so it appears on the last rung only: a refused reader
// is not offered an action on a screen they cannot open.
