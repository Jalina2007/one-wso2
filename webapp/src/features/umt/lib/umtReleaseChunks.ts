// How a build status reads on screen. The backend's vocabulary is open-ended,
// so anything not listed below — including a status that never arrived — is
// reported as a failure rather than silently rendering as blank.
//
// Two of these are the same state under two names: a product or TG build in
// flight reports BUILDING and one that finished reports SUCCESS, while the
// CST build reports IN_PROGRESS and SUCCEEDED for the same two things. Both
// spellings are listed because a running build that read as a failure would
// send someone chasing a problem that isn't there.
//
// One colour per status, carried by the chip's outline and its text alike.
// The colours have to hold up without a fill behind them, so the two that are
// merely waiting (not triggered, no build job) are greys, and the two that
// are unfinished business (pending, unstable) are ambers kept far enough
// apart to tell apart at a glance.
