/**
 * The pending grid's look: the base above plus gridlines.
 *
 * A pending row is a little table of its own — up to eight columns, six of
 * which render one entry per update level — and without a rule between the
 * columns it reads as an undifferentiated wall of chips and icons. The shaded,
 * ruled header does the same job for the two-tier header, separating the
 * column-group titles from the column titles beneath them.
 *
 * The borders are written longhand rather than with the `borderRight: 1`
 * shorthand. The DataGrid sets its own `border-*` shorthands from CSS
 * variables, and jsdom's CSS parser throws when a shorthand it has already
 * stored as a string is re-expanded, which takes these grids out of the tests
 * entirely. The longhands compose with the grid's own rules instead.

// A column that is its own group carries its title in the upper header row
// with nothing beneath it. The grid draws a rule under every group title, but
// on these three that rule splits a single header in half rather than
// separating a group from its members, so it is dropped for them and kept
// under "Build Details", where it does separate a title from the six columns
// it covers.
//
// `data-fields` is how the grid labels a group header with the fields it
// spans, wrapped in |- -| so a group over "id" cannot match one over "id2".
// The rule itself sits on the title container inside the header, not the
// header, which is what has to be overridden.
